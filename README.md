# Grid Noise [[Demo](https://ccorcos.github.io/grid-noise/)]

I was inspired by the grid layout on top of the [Hyve synth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMDURsBLIOY) and thought it would be fun to experiment with different types of grid note layouts.

Currently, I've only implemented a square grid, but you can open up `SquareGrid.tsx` and change the scale and the offset of each row.

Eventually, I'd like to implement similar grid synths for triangles, hexegons, and other tessellations.
